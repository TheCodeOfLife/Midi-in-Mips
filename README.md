# Midi-in-Mips

For a final project in my Computer Organization course at UNC, we were required to make some kind of practical, more advanced program in the MIPS instruction set architecture, using Assembly code. I chose to try to come up with a creative application, and I found that there was a built in syscall for playing sound in a java application. (what MARS, the MIPS IDE, was coded in)

Write any song made of the 6 attributes of midi notes into memory, and run the program to see your song come to life! You can even specify volume, speed, and octave all at runtime no matter the song.
